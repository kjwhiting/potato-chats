# 🥔 potato-chats

A chatbot specifically designed to tell you **everything** about potatoes.

The goal is to build a basic chat interface that integrats AI to answer questions about potatoes and (eventually) enabling two AIs to chat with each other about their favorite topic—potatos.


How to run locally:

The backend and front end are seporate. This means npm install needs to be run in the `server/` folder and the `client/` folder. After than you can run `npm run dev` in each and the application should run. As the interface gets more complex I will update here.

Keep in mind this is not intended for production use. I'm just playing around with ideas locally to see how AI api's work and how to integrated it.
